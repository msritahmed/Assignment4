✅ HDL source: Separate files for USFE, TM, DME, and top-level.

✅ Testbench: Self-checking with asserts and clear pass/fail messages.

✅ EDA Playground public link: shows passing simulation, with instructions in the README.

✅ Resource/timing report: PDF or text exported from your FPGA tool.

✅ Brief documentation: The sections above, with your own diagrams and explanation.

✅ (Optional bonus): A small config block for runtime address mapping.
